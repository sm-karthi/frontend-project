At the end of the event, the students gave me a handwritten card with a beautiful note that really touched my heart. It read, "A picture maybe worth a thousand words, But a mentor is a key to see a thousand words."

It was such a thoughtful gesture, and I was truly moved by their kind words. As a mentor, it's always rewarding to see the impact you can have on someone's life and career. It's incredible to think that my insights and experiences could help inspire and guide the next generation of tech professionals.
