# Learning has no limits

![WhatsApp Image 2022-06-28 at 4.48.32 PM.jpeg](/images/old-it-dood-learning-has-no-limits.jpeg)

I usually get many calls and WhatsApp messages from students and working professionals from various cities and countries asking for doubts. It's a usual thing in my daily life. I don't consider this a disturbance. I will happily help them by sharing knowledge. I don't ask their name and location. I will just answer their question. Usually, these people will be college students or working professionals who recently switched to new technology.

Last week I got a call from a Person called Gopalakrishnan from Pondichery. His age is around 60, and he said that "Sir... I am your student" ðŸ¤” he said he has been learning Nodejs and Angular from all my videos for the past month, and he needs my guidance and wants to meet me in person.

I tried to convince him to talk on the phone or virtual meet. But he is very particular about meeting me in person. I wanted to avoid him, but he finally convinced me to meet on Monday afternoon at my home.

He looked like my grandfather when I first saw him. He came with a notebook in his hand and said that these were the notes he took from watching the video. I was really shocked to see that notebook ðŸ˜². He wrote all the critical concepts in each video, and those notes were very detailed.

I was curious to know about his background. He is a software developer during the '90s. He built his own DOS-based billing software and deployed it to many supermarkets during 1990. After windows were introduced in India, his business got slowdown, and he tried to adopt the software to windows. He managed to adopt Windows 98, but after Windows 7 and XP, he couldn't succeed. But he still has few clients using the old DOS-based billing software.

He was worried that he was not getting any maintenance requests from his clients because his software was very stable.

*My Mind Voice : Ithuku than SaaS plaform ready panna maasa masam kaasu varum..*

Now at 60, he wants to build that billing software again in new technology on his own coding and development. ðŸ˜³ . Even though his idea needs many new innovations, he has many competitors in the market. I didn't want to discourage him and shared my knowledge about SaaS platforms and startup products.

I was delighted to meet another old IT Dood ðŸ˜€. Realised that #EachOneTeachOne videos are substantially impacting a few people and careers. More videos to come with more knowledge to share.
